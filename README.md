## 0. Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order.
(Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface)

## 1. Insertion sort
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
(works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.)
