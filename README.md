## 0 Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a sorting  algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order.
 (Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface)

## 1 Insertion sort
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
(works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game)

## 2 Selection sort
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

## 3 Quick sort
Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach..

## 4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
Shell sort is a generalized version of the insertion sort algorithm. It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted.
The interval between the elements is reduced based on the sequence used.
